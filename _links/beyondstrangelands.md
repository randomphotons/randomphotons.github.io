In a thrilling quest to unravel a decades-old mystery, Fiona and her grandson Ethan uncover a collection of old audio tapes left behind by her mother Melissa, who disappeared in search of her missing husband, paranormal expert Grant Peters. As they follow the clues, they confront sinister forces that will stop at nothing to keep the truth hidden.
