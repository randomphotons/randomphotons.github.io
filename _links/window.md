This montage of time-lapse photography from the International Space Station is collected from many taken in Expeditions 29, 30 and 31.

The goal with this sequence was to bring attention to the station itself, including the humans aboard it, particularly Don Pettit (appearing in the final shot) who took many of the sequences in this montage.
