Satellites can be [hard to spot](http://www.esa.int/spaceinvideos/Videos/2016/05/Satellites_in_space) by humans in space, but occasionally the camera does pick them up. You can see one in this video around the middle of the screen at <a href='#' onclick='return skipTo("0:47")'>0:47</a>.

You will notice that it appears just as the sun is beginning to rise in both this video and the one [here](http://www.esa.int/spaceinvideos/Videos/2016/05/Satellites_in_space). The light from the sun, at that angle, makes them easier to spot at that time.
