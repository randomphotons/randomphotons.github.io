The original time-lapse sequences whip by pretty quickly, so I slowed them down in Final Cut Pro X using the 'Optical Flow' method. From the [Apple website](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH12643?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US):

> Optical Flow: Adds in-between frames using an optical flow algorithm, which analyzes the clip to determine the directional movement of pixels and then draws portions of the new frames based on the optical flow analysis.

Because the movement of pixels is quite rapid toward the bottom of the frame, the analysis has trouble tracking it, especially when it encounters a fixed object like the frame of the ISS. As such, you get some 'rippling' or 'warping' of the image in those areas.
