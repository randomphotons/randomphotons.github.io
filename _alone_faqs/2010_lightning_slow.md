If you slow down the video, you will notice that the lightning flashes appear for 2 or 3 frames at times. A time-lapse will only capture a single flash for a single frame.

However, to make the sequences last longer, I slowed them down to about 50%, so each frame from the original time-lapse lasts about 2 frames in this video. My video editing software created extra frames to fill in the gaps, so flashes get stretched across a couple of frames.
