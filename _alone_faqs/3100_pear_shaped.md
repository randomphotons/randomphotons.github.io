In one of his many 'mythbuster' interviews, **Neil DeGrasse Tyson** mentions that the Earth is technically not a perfect sphere, but rather an 'oblate spheroid' and is in fact 'pear-shaped'. Here is the video:

This is true. However, some construe this to mean that the Earth will look like an actual pear. If you watch the whole interview he clearly says that at a cosmic level, the Earth is practically a perfect sphere.

As indicated in [this article](https://www.universetoday.com/15055/diameter-of-earth/), the diameter is **12,756 km** at the equator and **12,713 km** at the poles. That gives us a difference of **43 km**. In percentage terms, the diameter is only **0.34%** bigger at the equator - about 1/3 of 1%.

If the Earth was the size of a marble, we could barely detect mountains and oceans with our finger, let alone a slight bulge of less than 1%.
