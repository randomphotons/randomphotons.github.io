# Is this CGI?

All the sequences in the video are [real photographs](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/photo.pl?mission=ISS028&roll=E&frame=33400) taken with a decent stills camera (typically a Nikon) with long exposure time. The only thing special about them is they are taken from a space station orbiting the Earth.
