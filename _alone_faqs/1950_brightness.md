# Why are the lights so bright?

If you were looking out the window of the ISS yourself, they would not be so intense.

The photos were taken with a long exposure (about 1-3 seconds per photo, depending on the sequence), which allows the camera to capture more light.

Additionally, the contrast and saturation were boosted to help them pop a bit more in the video.
