Here is an image from the European Space Agency depicting how satellites are dispersed around the Earth:

So many satellites! Why can't we see any in the video?

Keep in mind that the image above is not to scale. The satellites depicted are huge compared to reality. Even if they were a single pixel they would still be gigantic.

Let's do some math and figure out how much distance will actually be between satellites on average.

According to the [UN Office for Outer Space Affairs](http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/osoindex/search-ng.jspx?lf_id=#?c=%7B%22filters%22:%5B%7B%22fieldName%22:%22en%23object.status.inOrbit_s1%22,%22value%22:%22Yes%22%7D,%7B%22fieldName%22:%22en%23object.status.objectStatus_s1%22,%22value%22:%22in%20orbit%22%7D%5D,%22sortings%22:%5B%7B%22fieldName%22:%22object.launch.dateOfLaunch_s1%22,%22dir%22:%22desc%22%7D%5D,%22match%22:null%7D) (yes, this department actually exists!), about **3056 satellites** are in **low Earth orbit** (an altitude of 180 km to 2,000 km).

Earth has a **circumference** of about **40,000 km**. If all **3056 satellites** were lined up around the equator at the same altitude, there would be **one every 13 km**.

However, they are dispersed all around the planet in a range of different orbits. The Earth has a **radius** of about **6367 km**. Add **400 km** for the altitude of the ISS and you get **6767 km**. Given the formula for calculating the surface area of a sphere is **_4 x &pi; x r<sup>2</sup>_**, that gives us a surface area of **509,424,190 km<sup>2</sup>**. Divide that by **3056** and you get **1 satellite** in every **124,951 km<sup>2</sup>**, or every **353 km by 353 km square**, if you prefer to think of it that way.

That's a lot of empty space.

Satellites do exist, and the ISS has to plan its orbit to generally keep out of the way of any known hazards, but it is not exactly a traffic  jam up there.
