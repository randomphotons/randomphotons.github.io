The ISS's altitude isn't high enough to see the full curve of the earth. However, it can see a reasonably large segment of the earth, enough to see a curve on that segment. Here are some scale diagrams to help illustrate it:

Firstly, here is a scale diagram of the earth and the ISS (click to zoom in):

The <span style="color: red">red line</span> is the visible horizon from the ISS at an altitude of **400 km**.

Next, here is an overhead view, looking down towards the ISS, with the red circle being the visible horizon from the ISS:

The <span style="color: red">red circle</span> is the horizon, the same as the red line in the first diagram, looking down from 90ยบ. The black **"Flat Horizon"** is a tangent to the Earth's horizon, and is what would be visible as a straight line when looking at the horizon from the ISS. The <span style="color: orange">orange lines</span> indicate a field of view of **100ยบ** when using a **15 mm lens** on a **35mm sensor**, as was the case for most of these sequences.

Here are the same details, from an off-centre perspective:

And here is the view you get from the ISS, looking directly at the horizon, with a <span style="color: orange">field of view</span> of 100ยบ, which is what is present on a 15 mm lens:

And an actual photo from the ISS, taken with a 15 *mm* lens on a Nikon D3S, for comparison:
