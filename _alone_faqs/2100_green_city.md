Most of the lights on the ground have a yellow hue. But at [0:30](#){:onclick="return skipTo('0:30')"}, there is a patch of city lights that looks green.

It turns out that this is the country of Guatemala. In 2009, the government [planned to replace street lighting](https://m.centralamericadata.com/en/article/home/Guatemala_18_Million_for_Street_Lightning) with environmentally-friendly LED lamps. As indicated in [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/19yo2a/why_is_guatemala_green_during_the_international/) it seems they had made some progress by 2011 when this sequence was recorded.
