# Why don't we see a full orbit of the Earth?

It's a technical reason basically. To capture as much light as possible at night, the camera is set to a long shutter speed and a wider open aperture. When the sun comes up, it is over-exposed and just becomes white-hot.

Here's one of the original still frames from the end of the first sequence in this video:

Why not let the exposure adjust automatically? It's possible, but it results in [flickering frames](https://www.learntimelapse.com/time-lapse-exposure-avoiding-flicker-and-dragging-shutter/), because the camera adjusts constantly. It's hypothetically possible to [shoot night-to-day time-lapses](https://prestonkanak.com/2013/06/12/how-to-shoot-day-to-night-time-lapses/), but it's complicated and time-consuming. These ones were all done pretty simply.

If you want to see some daylight sequences, you can find some in my other video, [The World Outside My Window](https://youtu.be/GOAEIMx39-w).
