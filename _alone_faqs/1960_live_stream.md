The ISS has several [high-definition cameras](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/ESRS/HDEV/) which send a live stream with views of Earth. It provides great views during the day, but at night it is basically black.

The cameras, like everything on the ISS, is an experiment that happens to have a nice side-effect for us here on the surface. But the goal of the expiriment is to [test how commercial-level cameras function in space](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/ESRS/HDEV/).

According to [Chuck Claunch](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/9571), who helped build the system, the settings are left on settings for daylight exposure so that "dead pixels" are easier to spot when it's black at night. As such, you won't see much from the live stream when it's on the night side of the Earth.

These videos, on the other hand, are composed from multiple photographs taken cameras set to capture as much light as possible with at least 1 second of exposure. This gives us images that are much brighter than they would be even to to the naked eye.
