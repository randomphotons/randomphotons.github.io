# I spotted an error

There are several errors in the video, including:

- Footage of Stalin in [1957](https://youtu.be/PLcE3AI9wwE?t=57) (although this was pulled from the same location in the [original documentary](https://archive.org/details/RaceForSpace)).
- A typo of "Suyez" for [Soyuz T10-1](https://youtu.be/PLcE3AI9wwE?t=149).
- Listed Skylab's launch date as [April 19, 1971](https://youtu.be/PLcE3AI9wwE?t=126) instead of [May 14, 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab).
- Listing Mir's country of origin as ['Russia' not the 'USSR'](https://youtu.be/PLcE3AI9wwE?t=161).

[Let me know](mailto:productions@randomphotons.com?subject=Escape Velocity Error) if you spot any others - I'll try to correct them in the [next version](#update).
