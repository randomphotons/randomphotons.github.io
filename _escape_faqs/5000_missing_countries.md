# Why are some countries missing?

There were several significant events that I would have liked to include in the video, including (but not limited to) China putting [Yang Liwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liwei) into orbit and India's [Chandrayaan-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-1) mission confirming water ice on the Moon. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to due to being unable to clear copyright on these images. The government (or government-owned media) own copyright for all public media for those missions, and I was unable to determine if it could be used in this context.
