# Why are there some missing milestones?

The goal was to keep the video short and to the point, so not everything could be included. There are a few events I would include on a future update, should such a video transpire. In particular, this would include cosmonauts and astronauts who perished, such as:

- [Vladimir Komarov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Komarov) on [Soyuz 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1)
- [Georgy Dobrovolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Dobrovolsky), [Vladislav Volkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Volkov), and [Viktor Patsayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Patsayev) on [Soyuz 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_11)
- [Gus Grissom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Grissom), [Ed White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_White_(astronaut)), and [Roger B. Chaffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_B._Chaffee) on [Apollo 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1)

There may be a couple of other milestones missed, such as [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8) (first manned mission around the Moon).
