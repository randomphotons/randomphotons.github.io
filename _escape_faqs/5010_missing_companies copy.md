# Where are Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic?

Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic both license their images and footage through Getty Media, which I chose not to purchase licenses for due to both philosophical and financial reasons.

NASA and SpaceX have made their media available on a more permissive basis, although SpaceX's position has become less clear in the years since 2016, when this video was made.
