# Wasn't Laika was launched in 1957?

You are correct! The dogs (yes, there are two) in this video are actually named [Dezik (Дезик) and Tsygan (Цыган, "Gypsy")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_dogs), and were launched into sub-orbital space (above the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kármán_line)) in 1951.

[Laika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika) was on [Sputnik 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_2), which was launched on November 3, 1957. She was the first dog to achieve orbit, but Dezik and Tysgan beat her into space.
